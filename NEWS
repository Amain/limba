Version 0.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-01-08

Notes:
 * The Limba package sources are now expected in the lipkg/ subdirectory
 * Packages are signed by default. Pass the --no-signature option to
   lipkgen to disable this. Package signing requires a running GPG agent
   at time.

Features:
 * Allow installations without setting the suid bit
 * Improve performance of the config parser
 * Add initial foundations list
 * Implement support for signing packages
 * Handle arch:any notation in package sources
 * Validate signatures of IPK packages
 * lipkgen: Allow disabling of package-signing
 * Expose trust-level in installer
 * lipkgen: Print better signing result messages
 * Use PolKit to check for authorization
 * Call helper for privileged local-install action
 * Don't use the generic, odd "pkginstall" name for lipkg sources
 * Time out helper daemon on inactivity
 * Write improved compiler error output in maintainer mode

Bugfixes:
 * runapp: overlayfs is called overlay (Harald Hoyer)
 * runapp: Use "overlayfs" on older Linux kernels
 * Fix typo in runapp.c (blackout24)
 * lipkgen: Fix extraction of packages if no destination directory is defined
 * Check for architecture match when installing
 * Always create format-versioned packages
 * Warn about empty package-ids
 * When loading pkg metadata, do not override metainfo values with NULL
 * Dont crash if we encounter e.g. a non-armored signature
 * Increase GPG keyserver timeout
 * Adjust to AppStream API changes

 * Implement embedded-dependency generation into package builder
 * Compress base IPK archive using GZip
 * Make API a bit more GUI-friendly
 * Allow using a different AppStream library for data loading
 * lipkgen: Allow generating a very simple project structure

 * Write a magic number into IPK packages
 * Mark packages which have not been installed manually as automatic

Bugfixes:
 * Get rid of li_touch_dir helper
 * Test for component metadata earlier
 * Add more GIR annotations
 * Clean up blank values in config metadata
