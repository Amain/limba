Version 0.5.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-11-10

Notes:
 * This release contains some pretty invasive changes. It also
   marks the point where Limba is pretty much feature-complete,
   so expect a lot of polishing during the next releases, and
   please intensively test this release.
 * If you are using Linux 4.2 and try to use limba-build, you might
   run into this kernel regression: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/7/289
   We can't work around this in Limba, so consider patching/updating
   your kernel.
