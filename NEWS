Version 0.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-02-20

Features:
 * Add new lirepo tool to create repositories
 * Allow adding packages to a repository
 * Compress Index file of repositories
 * Make cache download repository metadata
 * repo: Register AppStream metadata files
 * Use Freedesktop namespace for DBus service and PolKit rules
 * Make Limba DBus service kdbus-safe
 * Encode architecture in repo package names
 * Allow Limba to query the package cache
 * Write single cache file for AppStream metadata
 * Use the new "bundle" tag in AppStream 0.8
 * Implement installations from remote sources
 * Handle multiple architectures inone repository
 * Sign repositories by default
 * lipa: Add command to receive & trust a key
 * tests: Add fake GPG home with dummy key
 * lipa: Implement command to install remote package
 * Encode requirements in runtime definition
 * Set systemd service name in D-Bus service file
 * Implement a very simple way of listing potential updates
 * Implement update mechanism


Bugfixes:
 * Use pool.sks-keyservers.net as default keyserver
 * Fail with a less scary message if signing key could not be fetched
 * Collect cruft packages on system shutdown
 * Get rid of all unit-test hacks by creating a fake root environment
 * Perform some loose kernel version checks before compiling Limba
 * Disable Travis CI: We need a recent kernel with OverlayFS now
 * Fix keyring test again, by giving the test container network access
 * Fix some potential bugs found by static code analysis
 * Don't filter languages when reading AppStream metadata
 * Fool the testsuite, since GPGMe is still not behaving like the docs say
 * Don't list faded packages as installed

Version 0.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-01-08

Notes:
 * The Limba package sources are now expected in the lipkg/ subdirectory
 * Packages are signed by default. Pass the --no-signature option to
   lipkgen to disable this. Package signing requires a running GPG agent
   at time.

Features:
 * Allow installations without setting the suid bit
 * Improve performance of the config parser
 * Add initial foundations list
 * Implement support for signing packages
 * Handle arch:any notation in package sources
 * Validate signatures of IPK packages
 * lipkgen: Allow disabling of package-signing
 * Expose trust-level in installer
 * lipkgen: Print better signing result messages
 * Use PolKit to check for authorization
 * Call helper for privileged local-install action
 * Don't use the generic, odd "pkginstall" name for lipkg sources
 * Time out helper daemon on inactivity
 * Write improved compiler error output in maintainer mode

Bugfixes:
 * runapp: overlayfs is called overlay (Harald Hoyer)
 * runapp: Use "overlayfs" on older Linux kernels
 * Fix typo in runapp.c (blackout24)
 * lipkgen: Fix extraction of packages if no destination directory is defined
 * Check for architecture match when installing
 * Always create format-versioned packages
 * Warn about empty package-ids
 * When loading pkg metadata, do not override metainfo values with NULL
 * Dont crash if we encounter e.g. a non-armored signature
 * Increase GPG keyserver timeout
 * Adjust to AppStream API changes

Version 0.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2014-12-02

Notes:
 * This version is still experimental and not API-stable
 * This release uses /opt/bundle as root prefix now.

Features:
 * Add write-support for package-index
 * Implement support for installing packages with embedded dependencies
 * Implement embedded-dependency generation into package builder
 * Compress base IPK archive using GZip
 * Make API a bit more GUI-friendly
 * Allow using a different AppStream library for data loading
 * lipkgen: Allow generating a very simple project structure
 * Register wrappers for new binaries
 * Allow dependencies in child packages to be satisfied by parent-packages
 * Only register commands for executable files in /bin
 * Make installer respect version number and version relations
 * lipkgen: Try to pretty-print the autogenerated XML
 * Write a magic number into IPK packages
 * Mark packages which have not been installed manually as automatic
 * Use /opt/bundle as root
 * lipkgen: Add command to dump the contents of a package
 * lipa: Add command to clean up unused packages


Bugfixes:
 * Get rid of li_touch_dir helper
 * Test for component metadata earlier
 * Add more GIR annotations
 * Clean up blank values in config metadata
 * Only add ROOT/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * Only create a runtime for packages which need one
 * Make sure we always create complete runtimes on installation
 * Reset cache after cleanup

Version 0.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2014-11-16
