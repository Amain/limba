API
***

Limba contains a shared library (``liblimba``) which provides high-level interfaces to the Limba bundling
system, as well as some useful primitives to work with the Limba application environment.

Its primary usecase would be in software centers, or tools needing fine-grained access to Limba functions.
In case you don't need that, use the command-line interfaces instead.

Please keep in mind that the C API is subjected to change!


The API documentation can be found on `p.fd.o/~mak/limba/docs/api`_.
